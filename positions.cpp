  TO COMPILE:

     ./positions some-words.txt
  
  This file contains some toy code which illustrate example
    usage of the standard template library unordered_map class 
    among other things.  Some other C++ concepts illustrated
    include:

        the std::sort function
        command-line arguments
        opening and reading from files
        the "foreach" construct to iterate over elements
           in an STL "container"

  The program itself reads a text file and builds a
  "frequency-count" data structure using an unordered_map.

  For each ditsinct string in the input file, the map 
  keeps track of the number of time that string appears
  in the file.
